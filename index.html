        <p>My name is Boiketlo Yolanda Nzimande, but most people call me Yolanda‚Äîmy first name can be a
            bit tricky to pronounce! I was born and raised in South Africa,
            which has shaped who I am today. Fun fact about me is I am taking WDD130 for the second time, I was unable
            to complete
            it the first time due to personal reasons but I am excited to give it my all and succeed this time. When I'm
            not coding
            , you'll find me spending quality time with my best friends, diving into a good book, or
            losing myself in the rhythm of my favorite music.</p>

        <h2>South Africa</h2>
        <img src="images/flag_of_south_africa.webp" alt="flag_of_south_africa">
        <p>South Africa is one of the most geographically varied countries on the African continent, comprising
            territory that
            ranges from the rolling, fertile plains of the highveld and the wide-open savannah of Mpumalanga to the
            Kalahari desert
            and the peaks of the Drakensberg Mountains.
            In addition to possessing two of the world's most renowned wildlife reserves, the Kruger and the Kgalagadi
            Transfrontier
            Park, the country contains over a dozen smaller regional parks and reserves. With its excellent road and
            rail systems,
            its abundance of top-rated accommodation, and its bountiful farmlands, vineyards, and pristine beaches,
            South Africa
            truly offers "a world in one country".
