        <p>My name is Boiketlo Yolanda Nzimande, but most people call me Yolanda‚Äîmy first name can be a
            bit tricky to pronounce! I was born and raised in South Africa,
            which has shaped who I am today. Fun fact about me is I am taking WDD130 for the second time, I was unable
            to complete
            it the first time due to personal reasons but I am excited to give it my all and succeed this time. When I'm
            not coding
            , you'll find me spending quality time with my best friends, diving into a good book, or
            losing myself in the rhythm of my favorite music.</p>
