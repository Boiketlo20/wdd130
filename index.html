        <p>My name is Boiketlo Yolanda Nzimande, a South African name that tells a story of my heritage.
            Knowing it can be a bit of a tongue-twister for those unfamiliar, everyone simply calls me Yolanda. I am
            proudly born and raised in the vibrant and diverse landscape of South Africa, a background that has shaped
            my
            perspective and my creative spirit.
            My journey into the world of web design has been one of humble perseverance. I am currently doing
            WDD130 for the second time, a decision I made after my initial attempt didn't reflect the understanding I
            knew I
            was capable of achieving. Rather than seeing this as a setback, I chose to view it as an opportunity, a
            chance to build a
            stronger, more durable foundation for my skills.
            The difference this time around has been remarkable. Where I once felt lost and overwhelmed by the
            complexities of code, I now find myself engaging with the material with newfound clarity and confidence. The
            confusion that once
            made me want to give up has been replaced by the gratifying feeling of concepts clicking into place. This
            experience has
            taught me a profound lesson: that the struggle is a part of learning. I am empowered by the belief that "I
            can do all things through Christ
            who strengthens me."
            When I'm not coding, I cherish the simple joys that bring balance to my life. My heart is
            fullest when I'm
            sharing laughter and creating memories with my dearest friends, getting lost in the captivating pages of a
            good book, or letting the rhythm of my favorite music provide the soundtrack to my day. </p>

        <h2>South Africa</h2>
        <img src="images/south-african-flag.webp" alt="flag_of_south_africa">
        <p>South Africa is one of the most geographically varied countries on the African continent, comprising
            territory that
            ranges from the rolling, fertile plains of the highveld and the wide-open savannah of Mpumalanga to the
            Kalahari desert
            and the peaks of the Drakensberg Mountains.
            In addition to possessing two of the world's most renowned wildlife reserves, the Kruger and the Kgalagadi
            Transfrontier
            Park, the country contains over a dozen smaller regional parks and reserves. With its excellent road and
            rail systems,
            its abundance of top-rated accommodation, and its bountiful farmlands, vineyards, and pristine beaches,
            South Africa
            truly offers "a world in one country".
