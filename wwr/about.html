            <h2 class="title">History</h2>
            <p class="text1">Long before river rafting was a thrill-seeking adventure, it was a way of life. For
                centuries, the Indigenous peoples of
                the Missouri River, including the Mandan Tribe, were the original masters of its currents. The river was
                their highway,
                their pantry, and their heartline.
                The Mandan, who established large agricultural villages along the Upper Missouri, were renowned for
                their ingenuity.
                Their most distinctive river craft was the bull boat‚Äîa remarkable, circular vessel made by stretching a
                single buffalo
                hide over a sturdy frame of willow or cottonwood.</p>
            <img src="images/history.jpg" alt="Mandan Village">
            <p class="text 2">These agile, buoyant boats were ideal for transporting goods across the river and ferrying
                hides and crops for trade
                with neighboring tribes and, later, European explorers like Lewis and Clark, who relied on Mandan
                expertise to survive
                the winter of 1804.
                When you embark on a rafting trip today, you're participating in a timeless tradition. The sense of
                adventure and the
                profound respect for the river's power are a direct echo of the legacy left by the Mandan and other
                river peoples.</p>
